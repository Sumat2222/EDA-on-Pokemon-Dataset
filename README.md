#Pokemon Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis 

This repository contains a dataset and my analysis of the dataset on Jupyter Notebook.

I did some research on this data to clarify various attributes and to know which points to focus on in the analysis. After that, I used my raw knowledge of Pandas to do an analysis using Numpy, MatPlotLib and Seaborn in the process.
